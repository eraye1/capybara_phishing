# Phishing Detection Chrome Extension Product Specification

## Overview

A Chrome extension that leverages WebLLM to analyze emails for phishing attempts directly in popular webmail interfaces. The extension provides real-time analysis and alerts users of potentially malicious emails while maintaining privacy by performing all analysis locally.

## Core Features

### Domain Verification

- Monitors active browser tabs for known webmail domains
- Supported domains in initial release: mail.google.com, outlook.com
- URL validation ensures we're on legitimate email provider domains
- Domain allowlist/blocklist management

### Email Content Analysis

- Extracts email content from supported webmail interfaces using DOM manipulation
- Processes:
  - Email body (HTML and text)
  - Subject line
  - Sender information
  - Reply-to addresses
  - Attachment metadata
  - URLs and link text
- Maintains user privacy by performing all analysis locally via WebLLM
- Caches analysis results for previously seen emails

### Phishing Detection

- Returns structured analysis with:
  - Overall confidence score (0-100%)
  - Specific risk factors identified
  - Explanation of findings
  - Recommended actions
- Flags emails with:
  - High Risk: â‰¥90% phishing probability
  - Medium Risk: 70-89% probability
  - Low Risk: <70% probability
- Analyzes key phishing indicators:
  - Urgency/pressure tactics
  - Suspicious links
  - Domain spoofing
  - Credential requests
  - Sender legitimacy
  - Grammar and formatting issues
